# FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT 

## Assignment Description
Your task is to create a full-stack web application that allows users to view and interact with a list of users. The mock data for the users can be found at this link [Json Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ibmr3WD7Jw6oLL6O_W390WojCLfCHw-k/view?usp=sharing).
